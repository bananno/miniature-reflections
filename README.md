# Miniature Reflections

I created this website between 2009-2012 for my mom's business.
She created and sold handmade doll clothes modeled after Gainesville Ballet Nutcracker costumes.

In 2019, I created this repository to preserve the project.

The original address was **miniaturereflections.com**, but it is no longer online.
